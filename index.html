                René Gerónimo Favaloro (1923–2000) was an Argentine cardiac surgeon best known for developing the technique of coronary artery bypass surgery.
                He made significant contributions to the treatment of coronary artery disease, helping to save millions of lives worldwide.

                Favaloro’s journey in medicine began in La Plata, Argentina, but his breakthrough came in 1967, when he performed the first documented
                coronary bypass surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States. His revolutionary work remains a cornerstone of cardiac surgery.

                Beyond his surgical accomplishments, Favaloro was dedicated to improving healthcare access, education, and social justice. He returned to
                Argentina to establish the Favaloro Foundation, a medical training and research center that continues his legacy today.
